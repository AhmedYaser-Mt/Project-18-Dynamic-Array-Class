# 📦 Project 18 — Dynamic Array Class (C++, OOP)

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a custom **Dynamic Array** class from scratch using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming principles.

Instead of relying on built-in containers, we manually handle memory allocation and deallocation.  
The goal is to deeply understand how dynamic storage works internally and how real data structures are engineered.

This project is the foundation for future data structures that will be built on top of this class.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to:

- Create a reusable Dynamic Array class
- Manage memory manually using heap allocation
- Store and access elements safely
- Track array size internally
- Prepare a base structure for future enhancements

This is not just about storing values — it’s about understanding system-level behavior.

## 🧠 Concepts Applied

- Templates (Generic Programming)
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Constructors and Destructors
- Encapsulation
- Defensive Programming
- Reusability
- Clean Class Design

## 🏗 Design Philosophy

This class owns its memory.

When an object is created:
- Memory is allocated dynamically based on the requested size.

When the object is destroyed:
- Memory is released properly to prevent memory leaks.

The class controls:
- Its size
- Its memory
- How elements are accessed and modified

This ensures safe and predictable behavior.

---

## 🧩 Core Capabilities

The current version of the Dynamic Array supports:

- Initializing an array with a given size
- Setting values at specific indexes
- Checking if the array is empty
- Retrieving the current size
- Printing all elements

This is the base version.  
It will evolve step by step.

## 📌 Why This Project Matters

Previously, we built data structures based on **Linked Lists**.

Now we are building a structure based on **Dynamic Arrays**.

Different internal mechanics.  
Different memory behavior.  
Same architectural mindset.

This helps us understand:

- When to use arrays
- When to use linked lists
- Trade-offs between both approaches
- How internal design affects performance

---

## 🚀 Future Extensions

This is only the starting point.

Upcoming improvements may include:

- Adding elements dynamically
- Removing elements
- Resizing logic
- Inserting at specific positions
- Deleting at specific positions
- Searching
- Reversing the array
- Capacity management

This class will later be reused in other advanced data structures.

## 🗺 Learning Path

This project is part of a structured journey covering:

- Data Structures & Algorithms
- OOP Mastery
- Memory Management
- Design Thinking in Programming

The goal is not memorization.  
The goal is understanding architecture and thinking like an engineer.

## 💡 Key Takeaway

When you understand how dynamic memory works…

You stop depending on ready-made tools.

You start building your own.

And that’s when programming shifts from writing code  
to engineering systems.
